A C++ disassembler for the VideoCore IV GPU.

Based off of the instruction set described here:
https://github.com/hermanhermitage/videocoreiv/wiki/VideoCore-IV-Programmers-Manual

This project is more meant as a learning exercise for myself than
as anything production-worthy. Once I understand the instruction
set well enough, I'm hoping to support other related projects
support this instruction set.
