A C++ disassembler for the VideoCore IV GPU.

Based off of the instruction set described here:
https://github.com/hermanhermitage/videocoreiv/wiki/VideoCore-IV-Programmers-Manual

This project is more meant as a learning exercise for myself than as
anything production-worthy. Once I understand the instruction set well
enough, I'm hoping to support other related projects with this
instruction set.

The code here is written with testability and readability in mind, not
performance.
